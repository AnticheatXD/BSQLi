## Awareness

### Introduction to NoSQL Databases
NoSQL databases have gained popularity due to their scalability, flexibility, and schema-free nature. Common NoSQL databases include MongoDB, CouchDB, Firebase, and Cassandra.

### The Myth of NoSQL Injection Immunity
Many developers assume NoSQL databases are immune to SQL Injection attacks because they do not use traditional SQL queries. However, injection vulnerabilities still exist, especially **Blind NoSQL Injection (BSQLi)**.

### Real-World Cases
- **2019 MongoDB Ransom Attacks** – Attackers exploited unsecured NoSQL instances.
- **Firebase Exploits** – Researchers found security flaws allowing unauthorized access.

## Comprehension

### Understanding Blind NoSQL Injection
Blind NoSQL Injection occurs when an attacker interacts with a NoSQL database in a way that does not return direct error messages. Instead, the attacker deduces information through **Boolean logic, time delays, or Out-of-Band (OOB) techniques**.

```
User Input  ---> Application  ---> Database Query
      |                        |
      |                        V
      +----> Blind Injection ---> Information Leak
```

### Types of Blind NoSQL Injection
- **Boolean-Based Blind NoSQL Injection** – The attacker sends queries that return true or false responses, helping to infer database behavior.
- **Time-Based Blind NoSQL Injection** – By measuring the response time of specific queries, attackers can extract data without direct feedback.
- **Out-of-Band (OOB) Blind NoSQL Injection** – Exploiting NoSQL engines that process external interactions, such as DNS or HTTP requests, to exfiltrate data.

### Example Attack Scenarios
#### 1. Boolean-Based Injection
Consider a web application using MongoDB:

```javascript
user = db.users.findOne({"username": userInput, "password": passInput});
```

If the input is not sanitized, an attacker might inject:

```javascript
{"username": {"$ne": null}, "password": {"$ne": null}}
```

This bypasses authentication by always returning a valid user object.

#### 2. Time-Based Injection
If the database executes different queries based on conditional logic, an attacker can measure time delays to extract information:

```javascript
{"username": "admin", "$where": "sleep(5000)"}
```

A delay in response time indicates that the query successfully manipulated the backend logic.

```
Query Sent  ---> No Immediate Response  ---> Delay Observed  ---> Data Extracted
```

## Conviction

### Case Studies and Proof of Concept (PoC)
- **MongoDB Exploitation** – Security researchers demonstrated using Boolean-based blind injection to extract admin credentials.
- **Firebase Data Exfiltration** – Attackers used time-based blind NoSQL injection to determine the presence of certain records.

### Why This Matters?
Blind NoSQL Injection can lead to:
- **Data breaches**
- **Privilege escalation**
- **Complete application compromise**

## Action

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Use Parameterized Queries** – Avoid directly embedding user input in database queries.
- **Input Validation** – Sanitize user input to prevent malicious payloads.
- **Access Control** – Restrict database permissions to limit damage in case of an exploit.

### Red Teaming Techniques for Testing NoSQL BSQLi
- **Automated Scanners** – Tools like NoSQLMap help identify injection flaws.
- **Manual Payload Testing** – Crafting Boolean-based and time-based payloads for security assessments.
- **Logging and Monitoring** – Detect unusual query patterns to prevent exploitation.

### Future of NoSQL Security
With the rise of NoSQL databases, developers and red teams must adapt security measures to prevent evolving injection attacks. Investing in proactive security testing and secure coding practices is essential to mitigating these threats.
